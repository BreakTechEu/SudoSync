> **Note:** This repository (master branch) now tracks **SudoSync v2 (Beta)** featuring the experimental SudoSync ID system for private videos without standard online IDs. We are waiting for feedback, feature requests, and bug reports! For the older stable v1 release, please switch to the [v1-stable](https://github.com/BreakTechEu/SudoSync/tree/v1-stable) branch.

# SudoSync for Kodi

A lightweight background service add-on for Kodi that provides automatic, two-way synchronization of watch states, resume points, user ratings, and last-played timestamps across multiple Kodi instances in the same local network — without requiring an external MySQL/MariaDB server.

Synchronization relies on a shared network directory (SMB, NFS, or local share) and safe JSON-RPC API calls.

---

## Key Features

- **No Dedicated Database Required:** Uses a shared network path accessible by your devices (NAS, local PC, or network share).
- **Safe & Non-Destructive:** Interacts exclusively through Kodi's official JSON-RPC API. It never touches or locks internal SQLite files (`MyVideos*.db`) directly.
- **Robust Conflict Model:** Each synchronized field maintains its own logical version (Lamport clock) and client history, preventing race conditions, feedback loops, and desynchronization due to drifting client clocks. Atomic file locking safeguards the shared NAS state.
- **Optimized for Android TV & Streaming Devices:** A lightweight state diff engine handles platforms where Kodi occasionally fails to trigger `OnUpdate` or `OnStop` notifications.
- **Scraper & NFO Quarantine:** Newly scanned library items and NFO imports receive older internal versions to prevent accidental overwrites of existing shared playback progress.
- **Experimental SudoSync ID:** Automatically assigns and securely injects unique identifiers into `.nfo` files for private home videos that lack standard online scraper IDs.
- **Network ID vs UI Alias:** Distinctly separates internal network identifiers from user-friendly UI aliases to keep network mapping robust while displaying readable names.
